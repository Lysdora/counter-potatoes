# Counter-potatoes
## This is a counter to eat a lot of potatoes !

 ---
 This is my first JavaScript project, a simple potato counter! 
 Having fun and learning at the same time. 
 I used all the resources I learned from the :
 - Learn Programming course by Jad Joubran 
 - Learn JavaScript course on Scrimba.
 
 I still have a long way to go to become better at JavaScript.
